Credit Card Customer Churn Prediction Model

Introduction
This repository contains code and resources for building a machine learning model to predict credit card customer churn. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company. Predicting churn is crucial for businesses, as it allows them to identify at-risk customers and take proactive measures to retain them.

Task
The task of this project is to develop a predictive model that can forecast whether a credit card customer is likely to churn or not. This is a binary classification problem where the target variable is whether the customer churns (1) or not (0).

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains historical data of credit card customers, including various features such as demographic information, transaction history, account status, etc. The dataset is divided into features (independent variables) and the target variable (whether the customer churned or not).

Methodology

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features if necessary.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the distribution of features, correlations, and other patterns in the data.

Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve the model's performance.

Model Selection: Experiment with different machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc., to identify the best performing model.

Model Training: Train the selected model on the preprocessed data.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the model to optimize its performance.

Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model in a production environment for real-time predictions.

Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of 97.43% on the test dataset, with a precision of 97%, recall of 98%, and an F1-score of 98%.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the development of a machine learning model for predicting credit card customer churn. By identifying at-risk customers in advance, businesses can take proactive measures such as targeted marketing campaigns or personalized offers to retain customers and reduce churn rates.
